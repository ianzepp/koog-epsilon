====================

1. compiling with --enable-final breaks. Don't use for now.
2. compiling requires qt >= 2.2.2 and qt < 2.3.0
        - compiling with qt 2.2.2 works
        - compiling with qt 2.2.3 works
        - compiling with qt 2.2.4 works

        - compiling with qt 2.3.0 DOES NOT WORK. If somebody smarter than me
          can fix up the configure.in or whichever file to let it configure,
          I would be most grateful.

3. don't know what the minimum version of KDE is required. Suggest using
   at least KDE 2.1 ..

4. Would like some help with a debian package as well .. :)
